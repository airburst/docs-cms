# Menus

This section covers the management of menus; how to create new menus and populate them with links and sub-menus.

Menus are just another type of content in Umbraco, so if you have read the [Content Management](./file-management) section then you will already be familiar with how to create, move, copy, remove and perform other actions on content.

## View Menus

If you were migrated from Mylife version 3 then your menus have all been created in Umbraco.

Menus are found at the top level of your site folder tree.  Each menu is named and contains child links and potentially sub menus.

## Create a new Menu

* Give the menu item a name (as it will appear in links within your MyLife site)
* Set a link for the item; use the `choose page` link picker to select an existing page in your site, or type a Url into the text box
* Check the `Open in new window` checkbox if this is an external link and you want it to popup in a new tab or window
* Optionally set an `Access Key`; this is a single capital letter that is unique within the menu, which allows keyboard users to directly access the menu link by pressing `Alt + {Key}`

* You can optionally set an icon using `Font Awesome` styles, such as `fa fa-home`.  For more icons, see the [Font Awesome website](http://fontawesome.io)

!!! note
    Although you _can_ add icons to menu items, it is not recommended.  You invariably cannot find an apposite icon for every menu and given a choice of icons or text, for clarity, text always wins.

## Remove a Menu Item

* Click on the menu or item that you want to remove and select `Delete` from the actions button menu at the top right of the screen
