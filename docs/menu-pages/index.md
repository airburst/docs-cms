# Menu Panel Pages

## Menu Panels

`Menu Panels` or `Cards` are a great way to present a collection of visual links with more information and emphasis that you can achieve in a simple hyperlink.  They have been used in MyLife since the beginning, and are ubiquitious on the Web in Google+, Pinternest and a great many other sites.  In short, they are a familiar concept to most users.

A simplified menu panel looks like the picture below.  You can set how many cards you want across a row and then each card has a picture, text, link and some other aspects that will be described later.

Or if you prefer the Google Material Design way of things, then with pictures on top and a modest shadow beneath..

There are two ways to create this type of content in MyLife; you can use a `Menu Panel` widget inside a page layout, or - if this is the only thing that you want in the page - then you can create a `Menu Panel Page`.

## Create a Menu Panel Page

* Hover over a folder in the site content tree and click the ellipsis to the right to open the `Create` panel
* Click on `Menu Panel Page`
* The details panel will appear on the right of your screen, open at the `Menu Panel` tab (shown below):

Each field is explained in the table below:

|Item|Description|
| ------------- | ------------- |
|Intro Text|Explanatory information that will appear at the top of the page|
|Number of columns|You can choose to show 1 - 6 columns of cards in a row|
|Column height (px)|_Optional_ You can choose to set a minimum height for each row|
|Display mode|There are two modes; the `Menu` layout produces cards with an image above or below the headline and text, while a `List` layout displays images to the left of the headline and text.  `List` layout is the standard for `Guides` and works best with square pictures and 2 - 3 columns maximum.|
|Items|A collection of menu items (see below)|

Each Item has the following attributes:

|Item|Description|
| ------------- | ------------- |
|Title|The headline text displayed on the card|
|Teaser Text|A short paragraph outlining what the card will link the user to|
|Image|A [media picker](../content-articles/#media-picker) to set or upload a picture for the card|
|Link|A [link picker](../content-articles/#links-picker) to connect the card to another content item or an external hyperlink.  This is the resource that a user is directed to when they click on the card.  __Note:__ the `Open in a new window` checkbox should be checked for external links|
|Tile colour|A selection of 12 background colours for the card.  You can request a change to your colour palette through the Support Desk|
|Tile border|By default each card will have a 1px light border.  You can override this if you want a flat or [Material Design](https://material.google.com/) appearance.|
|GA|Google Analytics event name and label to capture click-throughs.|
|Tile shadow depth|An optional drop shadow beneath the card.|

!!! note
    It is important that you choose pictures with the same aspect ratio and pixel dimensions for best effect. Otherwise rows will look misaligned.  There is no masonry layout yet to deal with different sized cards.

## Other Actions

You can remove, move, copy and rollback `Menu Panel Pages` just like any other content item. Please refer to the [Content Management](../file-management) section for more information.
