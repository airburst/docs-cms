# Settings

If you are familiar with MyLife Version 3, settings were managed in the `Standard Pages` folder within Ektron CMS.  That folder contained Smart Forms, which allowed you to set values for text, button labels etc.

Settings are now a top-level item within your site content tree. Click the arrow to the left of the Settings link to display sections of grouped settings.
