# Introduction

MyLife version 4 uses the Umbraco Content Managment System (CMS); an application to create and change your site content (pages with widgets, articles, images, documents, etc.) and settings.

This help manual is designed to get you up and running with common tasks.  If you are new to MyLife or Umbraco, then you should start with the [orientation](./orientation/orientation/).  Otherwise you can jump straight into a chapter using the menu or search.
