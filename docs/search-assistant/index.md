# Search Assistant

`Search Assistant` (previously known as `Search Advisory`) listens to the search phrases that a user types in and when it finds a match, will add specific content into the results page.

This is a great way to promote services and signposting for commonly used searches.

## Create a Search Assistant

* You might want to create a new folder to keep all of your `Search Assistant` items in one place.  If not, you can always use search to find them quickly.
* As with all new content, start by hovering over the folder in the site content tree, that you want to create the `Search Assistant` inside
* Click on the ellipsis icon that appears to the right of the folder name
* Select `Search Assistant` from the `Create` panel options

* You will see a details panel on the right, opened at the `Content` tab

* The `Title` appears as a headline in the search results widget (see example below)
* The `Image` appears as the main picture in the search results widget.  This uses a [media picker](../content-articles/#media-picker) to search and select an existing, or upload a new picture.

* The `Summary` appears as the paragraph text, including links and even pictures or video
* `Search terms` is a phrase that triggers the widget to appear, e.g. _Respite care_. This text is case-insensitive
* Click the `Save and publish` button for the widget to take effect

## The Search Assistant in Action

Having created a `Search Assistant` for your chosen search phrase, simply type that phrase into a new saerch in MyLife to check the results. The phrase can appear anywhere in the full search text, __but it must be contiguous__.

You can remove, move, copy and rollback `Search Assistant` just like any other content item. Please refer to the [Content Management](../file-management) section for more information.
