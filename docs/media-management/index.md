# Managing Media

This section covers basic tasks to organise your media assets, such as uploading, moving, copying, removing and sorting images and files.

## Finding Media 

Media management in Umbraco is all done in the Media section; click on the `Media` button, below `Content` in the left-hand navigation bar.

You will initially see your site media content tree (collapsed in the figure below) and a Media panel on the right of the screen.

The media panel comprises, from the top down:

* A grid icon: click this to alternate between grid and list view of your media files in the currently selected folder
* A search box: start typing the name of a picture or file and a list of matches will appear in real time.
* An upload section: drag and drop files or images into the area surrounded by the dashed line, or click on the `or click here to choose files` link to open the standard file upload dialog
* A list of folders and media files in the currently selected folder, displayed in grid or list view, depending on your selection (see above)

If you hover over the top-level folder of your site, you will see an arrow to the left and an ellipsis to the right. Click on the arrow to open a folder.

As you can see, there is another search box above the tree. Start typing the name of a picture or file and a list of matches will appear in real time.

!!! Note
    If you have migrated from MyLife version 3, then your media folder structure will exactly replicate the structure that you had in Ektron CMS.

## View Media Properties

You can see the properties for any media file by clicking on that file and then clicking on the `Properties` tab in the Media panel to the right of the screen.

The properties panel includes information about the filename, file size and image dimensions, etc. Probably the most useful item though is the link. You can click this to open the image or file, or copy the url to use elsewhere. However, the media picker tool in Umbraco is so good that you generally won't need to inspect urls.
